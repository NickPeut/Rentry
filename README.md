The application is an atypical service for working with a database of real estate rental advertisements in St. Petersburg. The main reason for our application is the reverse process of renting an apartment.

When using our application, the tenant only needs to write about himself, select his preferred metro and expected offers.

The lessor is the user performing the main actions. In addition to posting advertisements, he searches for tenants he likes and sends them offers to rent an apartment.
